# Week 14: Rust CLI application

**Due**: End of week (Sunday at 11:59 PM)
**Points**: 10

## Overview

This is your Rust capstone project! Build a complete command-line interface (CLI) application that integrates all Rust skills: ownership, structs, traits, error handling, and idiomatic patterns.

## Materials

- 📋 **Lab instructions**: [lab14.md](./lab14.md)
- 📓 **Interactive exercises**: [notebook.ipynb](./notebook.ipynb) (if available)

## Quick start

1. **Read the lab instructions**: [lab14.md](./lab14.md)
2. **Plan your application**: Design your CLI structure
3. **Write your solution**: Build your Rust CLI app
4. **Test thoroughly**: Run all tests and manual testing

```bash
cd week14/

# Build and run
cargo build
cargo run

# Test
cargo test
cargo clippy
cargo fmt --check
```

5. **Commit and push**

```bash
git add week14/
git commit -m "Complete Week 14 lab"
git push origin main
```

## Expected repository structure

After completing this lab:

```
is4010-[your-username]-course/
├── week09-week13/       # Previous Rust weeks
├── week14/
│   ├── README.md         # This file
│   ├── lab14.md          # Lab instructions
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/
│       ├── main.rs       # CLI application entry point ✅
│       └── lib.rs        # Application modules ✅
└── README.md
```

## Need help?

1. Read [lab14.md](./lab14.md) thoroughly
2. Review previous Rust labs for patterns and examples
3. Build incrementally - one feature at a time
4. Ask on Microsoft Teams discussion board
5. Attend office hours
