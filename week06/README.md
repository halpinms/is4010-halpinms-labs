# Week 06: Object-oriented programming

**Due**: End of week (Sunday at 11:59 PM)
**Points**: 10

## Overview

This week introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts: classes, objects, constructors, methods, and inheritance. You'll model real-world objects using Python classes.

## Materials

- 📋 **Lab instructions**: [lab06.md](./lab06.md)
- 📓 **Interactive exercises**: [notebook.ipynb](./notebook.ipynb)
- 🧪 **Automated tests**: `tests/test_lab06.py` (if provided)

## Quick start

1. **Read the lab instructions**: [lab06.md](./lab06.md)
2. **Work through the notebook**: Practice OOP concepts
3. **Write your solution**: Create `lab06.py` with your classes
4. **Run tests locally** (if tests provided)

```bash
cd week06/
pytest tests/ -v  # If tests exist
```

5. **Commit and push**: Submit your work to GitHub

```bash
git add week06/
git commit -m "Complete Week 06 lab"
git push origin main
```

## Expected repository structure

After completing this lab:

```
is4010-[your-username]-course/
├── week01-week05/       # Previous weeks
├── week06/
│   ├── README.md         # This file
│   ├── lab06.md          # Lab instructions
│   ├── notebook.ipynb    # Interactive exercises
│   └── lab06.py          # Your solution ✅
└── README.md
```

## Need help?

1. Read [lab06.md](./lab06.md) thoroughly
2. Check the [troubleshooting guide](../resources/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
3. Ask on Microsoft Teams discussion board
4. Attend office hours
