# Week 07: Working with external data

**Due**: End of week (Sunday at 11:59 PM)
**Points**: 10

## Overview

This week covers working with external data: reading/writing files (JSON) and consuming web APIs. You'll build practical applications that persist data and fetch live information from the web.

## Materials

- 📋 **Lab instructions**: [lab07.md](./lab07.md)
- 📓 **Interactive exercises**: [notebook.ipynb](./notebook.ipynb)
- 🧪 **Automated tests**: `tests/test_lab07.py` (provided)

## Quick start

1. **Read the lab instructions**: [lab07.md](./lab07.md)
2. **Work through the notebook**: Practice file I/O and API calls
3. **Write your solution**: Create `lab07.py` with your code
4. **Run tests locally**: Verify your solution before pushing

```bash
cd week07/
pytest tests/ -v
```

5. **Commit and push**: Submit your work to GitHub

```bash
git add week07/
git commit -m "Complete Week 07 lab"
git push origin main
```
