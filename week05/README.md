# Week 05: Functions and error handling

**Due**: End of week (Sunday at 11:59 PM)
**Points**: 10

## Overview

This week focuses on refactoring procedural code into clean, reusable functions and making code robust through proper error handling.

## Materials

- 📋 **Lab instructions**: [lab05.md](./lab05.md)
- 📓 **Interactive exercises**: [notebook.ipynb](./notebook.ipynb) (if available)
- 🧪 **Automated tests**: `tests/test_lab05.py` (provided)

## Quick start

1. **Read the lab instructions**: [lab05.md](./lab05.md)
2. **Work through the notebook**: Practice function design and error handling
3. **Write your solution**: Create `lab05.py` with your code
4. **Run tests locally**: Verify your solution before pushing

```bash
# From week05 folder
cd week05/

# Run tests
pytest tests/ -v
```

5. **Commit and push**: Submit your work to GitHub

```bash
git add week05/
git commit -m "Complete Week 05 lab"
git push origin main
```

6. **Verify CI/CD**: Check GitHub Actions shows a green checkmark ✅
