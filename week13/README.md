# Week 13: Idiomatic Rust

**Due**: End of week (Sunday at 11:59 PM)
**Points**: 10

## Overview

This week focuses on writing idiomatic Rust code using iterators, error handling patterns, and Rust best practices. You'll learn to write Rust the way experienced Rustaceans do.

## Materials

- 📋 **Lab instructions**: [lab13.md](./lab13.md)
- 📓 **Interactive exercises**: [notebook.ipynb](./notebook.ipynb) (if available)

## Quick start

1. **Read the lab instructions**: [lab13.md](./lab13.md)
2. **Work through exercises**: Practice idiomatic patterns
3. **Write your solution**: Apply Rust best practices
4. **Run tests and linter**

```bash
cd week13/
cargo test
cargo clippy  # Pay attention to clippy suggestions!
```

5. **Commit and push**

```bash
git add week13/
git commit -m "Complete Week 13 lab"
git push origin main
```

## Expected repository structure

After completing this lab:

```
is4010-[your-username]-course/
├── week09-week12/       # Previous Rust weeks
├── week13/
│   ├── README.md         # This file
│   ├── lab13.md          # Lab instructions
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/
│       └── main.rs       # Idiomatic Rust code ✅
└── README.md
```

## Need help?

1. Read [lab13.md](./lab13.md) thoroughly
2. Listen to clippy suggestions - they teach idiomatic Rust
3. Review [error handling chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-00-error-handling.html)
4. Ask on Microsoft Teams discussion board
5. Attend office hours
