# Week 11: Structuring code and data

**Due**: End of week (Sunday at 11:59 PM)
**Points**: 10

## Overview

This week covers organizing Rust code with modules and defining custom data types using structs and enums. You'll build a complete student management system.

## Materials

- 📋 **Lab instructions**: [lab11.md](./lab11.md)
- 📓 **Interactive exercises**: [notebook.ipynb](./notebook.ipynb) (if available)

## Quick start

1. **Read the lab instructions**: [lab11.md](./lab11.md)
2. **Plan your module structure**: Design before coding
3. **Write your solution**: Create modules, structs, and enums
4. **Run tests locally**

```bash
cd week11/
cargo test
cargo clippy
```

5. **Commit and push**

```bash
git add week11/
git commit -m "Complete Week 11 lab"
git push origin main
```

## Expected repository structure

After completing this lab:

```
is4010-[your-username]-course/
├── week09-week10/       # Previous Rust weeks
├── week11/
│   ├── README.md         # This file
│   ├── lab11.md          # Lab instructions
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/
│       ├── main.rs       # Main application ✅
│       └── lib.rs        # Module definitions ✅

```

## Need help?

1. Read [lab11.md](./lab11.md) thoroughly
2. Review [modules chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch07-00-managing-growing-projects-with-packages-crates-and-modules.html)
3. Review [structs and enums](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html)
4. Ask on Microsoft Teams discussion board
5. Attend office hours
