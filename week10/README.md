# Week 10: Mastering ownership and borrowing

**Due**: End of week (Sunday at 11:59 PM)
**Points**: 10

## Overview

This week builds mastery of Rust's revolutionary ownership system and borrowing rules. You'll practice fixing ownership violations and implementing correct borrowing patterns.

## Materials

- 📋 **Lab instructions**: [lab10.md](./lab10.md)
- 📓 **Interactive exercises**: [notebook.ipynb](./notebook.ipynb) (if available)

## Quick start

1. **Read the lab instructions**: [lab10.md](./lab10.md)
2. **Work through exercises**: Practice ownership and borrowing concepts
3. **Write your solution**: Edit Rust source files
4. **Run tests locally**: Verify before pushing

```bash
cd week10/
cargo test
cargo clippy
```

5. **Commit and push**: Submit your work

```bash
git add week10/
git commit -m "Complete Week 10 lab"
git push origin main
```

## Expected repository structure

After completing this lab:

```
is4010-[your-username]-course/
├── week09/              # Previous Rust week
├── week10/
│   ├── README.md         # This file
│   ├── lab10.md          # Lab instructions
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/
│       └── main.rs       # Your solution ✅
└── README.md
```

## Need help?

1. Read [lab10.md](./lab10.md) thoroughly
2. Read Rust compiler errors carefully - they explain the issue
3. Review [ownership chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html)
4. Ask on Microsoft Teams discussion board
5. Attend office hours
