# Week 12: Generics and traits

**Due**: End of week (Sunday at 11:59 PM)
**Points**: 10

## Overview

This week introduces generic programming and trait implementation in Rust. You'll build a fully-functional generic stack data structure demonstrating `<T>` type parameters and trait implementations.

## Materials

- 📋 **Lab instructions**: [lab12.md](./lab12.md)
- 📓 **Interactive exercises**: [notebook.ipynb](./notebook.ipynb) (if available)

## Quick start

1. **Read the lab instructions**: [lab12.md](./lab12.md)
2. **Work through exercises**: Practice generics and traits
3. **Write your solution**: Implement generic stack
4. **Run tests locally**

```bash
cd week12/
cargo test
cargo clippy
```

5. **Commit and push**

```bash
git add week12/
git commit -m "Complete Week 12 lab"
git push origin main
```

## Expected repository structure

After completing this lab:

```
is4010-[your-username]-course/
├── week09-week11/       # Previous Rust weeks
├── week12/
│   ├── README.md         # This file
│   ├── lab12.md          # Lab instructions
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src/
│       └── main.rs       # Generic stack implementation ✅
└── README.md
```

## Need help?

1. Read [lab12.md](./lab12.md) thoroughly
2. Review [generics chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-00-generics.html)
3. Review [traits chapter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html)
4. Ask on Microsoft Teams discussion board
5. Attend office hours
