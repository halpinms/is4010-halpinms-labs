# Week 08: Python CLI application

**Due**: End of week (Sunday at 11:59 PM)
**Points**: 10

## Overview

This week you'll build a complete command-line interface (CLI) application that integrates all the Python skills learned so far: functions, OOP, file I/O, API calls, and error handling.

## Materials

- 📋 **Lab instructions**: [lab08.md](./lab08.md)
- 📓 **Interactive exercises**: [notebook.ipynb](./notebook.ipynb)

## Quick start

1. **Read the lab instructions**: [lab08.md](./lab08.md)
2. **Plan your application**: Review requirements and design your approach
3. **Write your solution**: Create `lab08.py` with your CLI app
4. **Test manually**: Run your application and verify all features work

```bash
cd week08/
python lab08.py  # Test your CLI application
```

5. **Commit and push**: Submit your work to GitHub

```bash
git add week08/
git commit -m "Complete Week 08 lab"
git push origin main
```

## Expected repository structure

After completing this lab:

```
is4010-[your-username]-course/
├── week01-week07/       # Previous weeks
├── week08/
│   ├── README.md         # This file
│   ├── lab08.md          # Lab instructions
│   ├── notebook.ipynb    # Interactive exercises
│   └── lab08.py          # Your CLI application ✅
└── README.md
```

## Need help?

1. Read [lab08.md](./lab08.md) thoroughly
2. Check the [troubleshooting guide](../resources/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
3. Test incrementally - build one feature at a time
4. Ask on Microsoft Teams discussion board
5. Attend office hours
